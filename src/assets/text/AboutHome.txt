Hello, my name is Kevin. Throughout my career as a teacher, I’ve doubled student participation and elevated the recognition of every school I’ve worked with by my enthusiasm and desire to empower people. By integrating innovative technology into my classroom, from choreographing marching band shows using computer-assisted software to incorporating cutting-edge music tools; I’ve always embraced new ways to enhance student learning.
Driven by my passion for technology and personal growth, I transitioned from education to software development. After completing an intensive full-stack coding bootcamp at Tech Elevator in Cincinnati, Ohio, I gained hands-on experience in a wide range of technologies. My eagerness to keep learning and growing makes me a valuable addition to any team, and I’m excited to contribute to a junior role.
