This Java code block is a QR code generator designed to be incorporated into the HomeInventory application. It creates custom QR codes that include a small logo in the center. The primary use case for these QR codes is for major appliances, enabling users to store essential information such as warranty details, maintenance records, service URLs, user manuals, and more. This functionality will enhance the HomeInventory app by providing quick access to key appliance information through a simple scan.
