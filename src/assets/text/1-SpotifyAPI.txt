â€‹This is a full stack application It utilizes the spotify-web-api-java library https://github.com/spotify-web-api-java/spotify-web-api-java. It is the result of a continuing education course I am taking. We started out with a simple get Artist method, and I grew the code a bit more. I can currently display pertinent artist information (images, genres, etc) from a search query. I have also added a search query for Albums which will display important facts about an album (title, image, tracks, record label, recording date, etc). I plan to continue building and styling this application over time.
