This Vue.js portfolio application is designed to showcase my programming skills and the diverse projects I've developed. Each project reflects my growth and learning during and after my coding bootcamp, demonstrating my ability to tackle a range of challenges. As I continue to expand my knowledge and complete new projects, this portfolio will be regularly updated to highlight my latest achievements.

The portfolio features projects such as the Regional Weather App, Joke-a-Quote-a-Day, Vintage Vinyl Archive, and Full Stack Tone Row Generator, each showcasing different aspects of my technical talent. Throughout this journey, I have worked with various technologies and tools, including Java, JavaScript, IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, GitHub, Vue.js, Command Line, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin, Spring Boot, Bootstrap, and Node Package Manager.

I invite you to explore my work and see the culmination of my dedication and passion for programming.
